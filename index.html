        <p>
            Dear Hiring Manager,<br>
            
            
            <br><br>
            I am writing to express my intrest in the <a href="https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/course-care/specialty-articles/four-practices-that-will-improve-any-greenkeeping-program.html">Greenskeeper</a> position at TaylorMade's beloved Kingdom. My passion for golf subconsciously began when my brother and I took a drive through the De Luz mountains 4-5 years ago.
            We ended up stumbling across <a href="https://www.crosscreekgolfclub.com">Cross Creek Golf Club</a>, it was a magical place. We thought to ourselves "when we start playing golf, we have to play here!"
            Fast forward a few years and I'm terribly better than my brother. It must be the Callaway clubs I picked up from Costco.
            <br><br>
            I am particularly drawn to TaylorMade because of the mystic that surrounds the Kingdom and the company's commitment in advancing the game. I grew up farming with my father, so I'm comfortable with agricultural practices in relation to this position.
            We recently purchased a bright Orange Kubota tractor, so I'm also comfortable around midsize equipment. Heck we even designed our crop irrigation system from scratch, so I'm confident in being able to take on repairs. 
            This new found passion for golf has instilled values I want to carry over into my professional career and this may be my opportunity to get my foot in the door.
            <br><br>
            I have been fixated on golf for about 3 years. Last year was the first year I watched golf from January to November before I took a break. It was a rollercoaster of a ride watching TaylorMade athletes compete at pinnacle of the sport.
            I'd say my most memorable moment was watching Rickie Fowler hold his own for 4 days straight at the Los Angeles U.S. Open. The way he carried the lead throughout the weekend was insane, I was glued to the TV. 
            Anyway I won't take up much more of your time, if you are still reading this please consider me for the position.
            I've also made my cover letter into a website because why not. I hope you enjoy my CV website. I began my web development career in hopes of growing within the magical Kingdom. 
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,<br>
            Emmanuel Hernandez
