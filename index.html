        <h1>Cover Letter</h1>
        <p>
            Dear Hiring Manager,<br>
            
            
            <br><br>
            I am writing to express my intrest for the Greenskeeper position at TaylorMade's beloved Kingdom. My passion for golf subconsciously began when my brother and I took a drive through the De Luz mountains 4-5 years ago.
            We eneded up stumbling across Cross Creek Golf Club, it was a magical place. We thought to ourselves "when we start playing golf, we have to play here!"
            Fast forward a few years and I'm terribly better than my brother. It must be the Callaway clubs I picked up from Costco.
            <br><br>
            I am particularly drawn to TaylorMade because of the mystic that surrounds the Kingdom. I don't believe this magical place exists. I grew up farming with my dad, so I'm comfortable with agricultural practices in relation to this postion.
            My dad also recently purchased a bright Orange Kabota tractor, so I'm also comfortable around midsize equipment. Heck we even desigined our irrigation system from scrtach, so I'm confident in being able to take on repairs, as well. 
            This new found passion for golf has instilled values I want to carry over into my professional career and this may be my opportunity to get my foot in the door.
            <br><br>
            I have been fixated on golf for about 3 years. Last year was the first year I watched golf from January to November before I took take a break. It was a rollercoster of ride watching TaylorMade athletes compete at a high level.
            I'd say my most memorable moment was watching Ricke Fowler hold his own for 4 days straight at the Los Angeles U.S. Open. The way he carried that lead through out the weekend was insane, I was glued to the TV. 
            Anyway I won't take up much more of your time, if you are still reading this please consider me for the position.
            I've also made my cover letter into a website because why not. I hope you enjoy my CV website. I began my web development career in hopes of growing within the magical Kingdom. 
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,<br>
            Emmanuel Hernandez
